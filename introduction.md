A short introduction: 

My main interests and expertise are in the areas of Languages & Culture and Programming & Information Technology.

**Programming**: I started programming in Turbo Pascal and Delphi with the computer course at high school, and have been part of  web development since the first PHP CMS in 2001 (PHP-Nuke). My current areas of interest are App Development with Flutter/Dart, JavaScript Frameworks (React), and the Lisp/Scheme descendant Racket.  

**Languages & Culture**: I have over 15 years of intercultural work experience in four languages in Europe and Asia (Japan, Vietnam). As a coordinator for the SLI (University of Freiburg), I organized and oversaw the programs for the International Language Courses with more than 1,000 participants from over 58 countries per year. 

Below you can see a selected list of organizations I have worked with and my areas of expertise and skills.
